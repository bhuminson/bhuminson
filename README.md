### Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bhumin Ben Son and I am currently a third year computer science student at Cal Poly. I'm also a part-time software engineer at iFixit. I love programming and I am currently learning full-stack web development. 

I dream that one day the code I write will be reached by people all around the world.
