### Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bhumin Ben Son and I am currently a third year computer science student at <a href="https://calpoly.edu">Cal Poly<a/> :mortar_board:. I'm also a part-time software engineer at <a href="https://ifixit.com">iFixit<a/> :wrench:. I love programming and at the moment I am exploring the path of full-stack web development :computer:. 

Check out my <a href="https://bhuminson.github.io">personal website<a/> :sparkles:!

I dream that one day the code I write will reach people all around the world everyday :earth_americas:.
